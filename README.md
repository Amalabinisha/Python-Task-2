# Python-Task-2

# Simple Console To-Do List App

## Objective

- Build a console-based to-do list manager in Python.
- Tasks are saved to a file for persistence.

## Features

- View, add, and remove tasks.
- All tasks are stored in tasks.txt.
- Tasks are loaded when app starts and saved after each update.

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Download `todo.py`.
3. Open terminal/command prompt.
4. Run: `python todo.py`

## How It Works

- Menu shows options: View, Add, Remove, Exit.
- Choose tasks by number.
- Tasks are listed and saved in tasks.txt.
- When app starts, previously saved tasks are loaded.

## File Structure

- `todo.py` : Main Python app
- `tasks.txt` : Task storage file (auto-created)

## Example Usage

- Add new tasks: Enter the name, press enter.
- Remove tasks: Enter the task number to delete.
- Exit: Option 4 quits the app.

## Code Concepts Used

- Lists for task management.
- File handling with `open()`.
- String manipulation: `.strip()`, `.append()`, `.pop()`
- Looping and conditional statements.
